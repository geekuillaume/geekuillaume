### Hi! I'm Guillaume ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french developer who love building stuff to help people with their everyday life. When I'm not working on my latest personnal project, I help companies build awesome products through my freelance business. I work mainly with small to medium sized startups and focus on being highly efficient in my code, my communication and most importantly my understanding of the product.

Some projects I'm proud about:
- ðŸŽ¶ [Soundsync](https://github.com/geekuillaume/soundsync): **I'm currently working on this** Soundsync is an open-source alternative to Sonos to broadcast music in your home on multiple speakers at the same time. It is compatible with a lot of different speakers and audio source.
- ðŸ’¬ [ChatUp](https://github.com/geekuillaume/ChatUp): I built a highly scalable web chat system for a YC startup that is now open-sourced. It handles +250k concurrent users and is customizable with plugins while being highly optimized to reduce server costs.
- ðŸ’¾ [DBacked](https://dbacked.com): My first SaaS that earned me a dollar! DBacked creates, encrypts and stores SQL database backups and makes sure that you'll never lose onew bit of your company data.

Have a suggestion about one of my project, need a freelance to help building your tech product or just want to talk? Send me an email! ðŸ˜ƒ
